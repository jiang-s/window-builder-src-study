	<exception id="5000" title="Component description missing">{product_name} couldn't find the
		description (*.wbp-component.xml file) for the component with class {0}. In general,
		{product_name} contains descriptions for all supported GUI components. Even if some
		component doesn't have a direct description, the description for its super class can be used
		(to some extent, for example, constructors require specific descriptions). It is expected
		that {product_name} will not try to ask for descriptions for components that can't be found.
		Please send a test case to support.</exception>
