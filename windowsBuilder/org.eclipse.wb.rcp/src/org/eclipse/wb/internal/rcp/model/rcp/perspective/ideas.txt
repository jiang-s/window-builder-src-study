  Component is:
  
1. Class and ComponentDescription.
2. CreationSupport.
3. VariableSupport.
4. Association.


  Class and ComponentDescription.
1. IPageLayout.addXXX() - no class.
2. IPageLayout.createXXX() - return class. But getObject() itself returns "null", just because we work
    with IPageLayout as with interface, we don't know its implementation.
    !!!!!!! May be we should implement it? !!!!!!!


  CreationSupport.
1. IPageLayout.addXXX() - VoidInvocationCreationSupport subclass, may be our Proxy implementation
    of IPageLayout will even return not-null object even for "void" methods.
2. IPageLayout.createXXX() - may be same as for IPageLayout.addXXX().


  VariableSupport.
1. IPageLayout.addXXX() - VoidInvocationVariableSupport.
2. IPageLayout.createXXX() - LocalUniqueVariableSupport, may be even with BlockStatementGenerator for
    folders.

  Association.
1. IPageLayout.addXXX() - InvocationVoidAssociation.
2. IPageLayout.createXXX() - InvocationVoidAssociation.


  EditorArea is ObjectInfo, implements some XXX interface to access its ID, Control and bounds.
  
  View/Perspective shortcuts and FastViews are ObjectInfo's, with special AbsComInfo-like methods to
    access bounds.
